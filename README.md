## Project Details

### About

FutonFlying is a web application inspired by CouchSurfing built using
Ruby on Rails as well as React/Redux. The basic premise is that users
(futonfliers) can stay with other users or host fellow travelers at no cost.

### 



By the end, FutonFlying will:
* Be hostable on Heroku
* Allow users to create account and login. A demo user will be provided as well
* Allow users to book a couch and/or futon as well as host other travelers
* Allow users to search for available listings off Google Maps
* Allow users to leave reviews of fellow users
* Interests and spoken languages tags for users

### Bonus Features

FutonFlying will, with time permitted, also include:
* Messaging
* Local Events
* Friends
* A forum for locals to answer questions from travelers
